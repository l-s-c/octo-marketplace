# Expert Marketplace API — v1

> Base path: **`/market/api/v1`**
> Owner: `octo-marketplace`
> Consumers: `octo-web` (`dmworkmcp` 专家市场 tab), later `octo-cli`
> Related brief: `.octospec/tasks/expert-catalog-v1/brief.md`
> Sibling contract: `docs/api/mcp-v1.md` (this doc mirrors its conventions)

This document is the authoritative behavior contract for the Expert Marketplace
CRUD slice of octo-marketplace. It covers two related-but-distinct entities —
**experts** (专家 / single agents) and **squads** (专家团 / expert teams). The
exact generated wire schema lives in `docs/openapi/swagger.yaml`; handler code,
tests, and client integration must stay aligned with both. Do not extend the
surface here without first updating this file and getting review sign-off.

---

## 0. Constants shared with the client

| Name | Value | Owner |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CATEGORY_KEY_ALL` | `"all"` | Reserved category key that disables the category filter on the list endpoints. |
| `SECRET_PLACEHOLDER_SENTINEL` | `"__OCTO_SECRET_PLACEHOLDER__"` | Same literal as `mcp-v1.md` §0. Authors are encouraged to use it inside `mcp_config` rather than embedding real tokens. v1 stores `mcp_config` verbatim and does not redact (see §6). |

### Type alignment between wire and TS

Wire responses are a **superset** of the current
`packages/dmworkmcp/src/mock/expertMock.ts` shapes (`ExpertAgent`,
`ExpertSquad`, `ExpertMember`). Extra fields shipped by the server are silently
ignored by the frontend today. Intentional extras the frontend will adopt when
it consumes the API:

- List items and details carry `visibility`; TS today does not.
- Details carry `created_at` / `updated_at`; TS today does not.

The doc uses "superset" and never claims a 1:1 type match. The prototype's
`mine` flag and `checkResult` field are NOT wire fields: `mine` is derived
client-side from `owner_uid == caller`, and `checkResult` is a runtime
environment probe with no persisted value.

## 1. Auth

Identical to `mcp-v1.md` §1. All endpoints (except health probes under `/`)
require a valid Octo token.

| Header | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `token` | Octo access token | Matches `octo-web`'s `WKApp.apiClient` convention. |
| `X-Space-Id` | Space UUID | Required on every endpoint; anchors visibility + ownership scope. |
| `Accept-Language` | e.g. `zh-CN, en;q=0.8` | Optional; forwarded to the token resolver. |

Server-side flow on every business request:

1. Resolve `token` → `Identity{uid, name}` via `internal/auth`. Failure →
   401 `AUTH_REQUIRED`.
2. Read `X-Space-Id`. Missing → 400 `VALIDATION_ERROR`.
3. Verify `uid` is a member of that Space via the authoritative Octo
   membership probe. Failure → 403 `FORBIDDEN`.
4. Never trust `owner_uid`, `space_id`, `creator_name`, or any identity field
   in the request body. These are stamped from steps 1–3, including the bot
   provenance triple (§3.1).

## 2. Error envelope

Every non-2xx response uses the standard OCTO OpenAPI error shape:

```json
{ "error": { "code": "NOT_FOUND", "message": "expert not found" } }
```

- `code` is the fixed OCTO wire enum (`tools/octo-api/references/api-spec.md`).
  Clients switch on `code`, not `message`.
- `message` is human-readable; never contains internal paths, credentials,
  SQL, or Go error strings.
- `details` / `hint` may appear inside `error` for validation failures.

### Error code catalog

| HTTP | Code (wire) | When |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 400 | `VALIDATION_ERROR` | Body fails structural validation: unknown field, bad visibility, malformed/oversized `mcp_config`, malformed `members`, empty required field. `error.details[]` may list offending fields. |
| 401 | `AUTH_REQUIRED` | Missing / invalid Octo token. |
| 403 | `FORBIDDEN` | Caller outside the requested Space, or not allowed to mutate the record. |
| 404 | `NOT_FOUND` | Record absent, or in a different Space (cross-Space discovery is closed). |
| 409 | `DUPLICATE` | Name collides with another live record owned by the caller in the Space. |
| 500 | `INTERNAL_ERROR` | Unclassified server error; details logged server-side only. |

Documentation-level reason labels (`err.marketplace.expert.*`) used in the
endpoint tables below map onto these wire codes; they are for humans reading the
doc, not additional wire enum values.

## 3. Resource shapes

Field names are `snake_case` on the wire and match the `octo-web`
`dmworkmcp` expert shapes where they overlap.

### 3.1 `ExpertSpec` — the shared "one expert" sub-schema

The trio that defines a single expert's behavior. It appears **twice**: at the
top level of an `ExpertAgentDetail` (§3.2), and inside every squad member
(§3.4). Implement it once on each side.

```json
{
  "instruction": "你是资深后端架构师……",
  "mcp_config": "{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"git\": { \"command\": \"npx\", \"args\": [\"-y\", \"@modelcontextprotocol/server-git\"] }\n  }\n}",
  "skills": [{"name": "架构评审清单"}, {"name": "容量估算模板"}]
}
```

- `instruction`: system prompt / role definition. Required (non-empty) — a
  blank value is rejected with `400 VALIDATION_ERROR`.
- `mcp_config`: the raw `mcpServers` config as a **JSON string** (exactly what
  the user typed in the config editor — see §6). Optional. Validated as
  well-formed JSON and size-capped on write; stored and returned verbatim.
- `skills`: on **read**, an array of skill objects
  `{name, has_content, can_download, file_name, file_size, files}` (the write
  shape differs — see below). A skill is a whole Agent-Skill package (a
  `.zip/.skill` containing `SKILL.md`) stored per-expert in object storage:
  - `has_content` (bool): a stored `SKILL.md` exists → fetch its text via the
    `skill_md` endpoint.
  - `can_download` (bool): the raw package is stored → get a presigned download
    URL via the `skill_download` endpoint.
  - `file_name` / `file_size`: the uploaded package's original name and byte size.
  - `files`: manifest of paths inside the package (for a bundled-file list).
  Empty array collapses to omitted.

  On **write**, each skill is one of two forms:
  - **Package upload** (installable, preferred):
    `{name, upload_object_key, file_name, file_size}`. First presign an upload
    (`POST /expert_skill_uploads`), `PUT` the raw `.zip/.skill` to the returned
    URL, then send its `upload_object_key` here. The server extracts `SKILL.md`,
    derives the authoritative `name` from its frontmatter, stores the package,
    and records the manifest. `upload_object_key` must be a key the upload-init
    endpoint minted (prefix `expert-uploads/`).
  - **Inline content** (legacy / name-only): `{name, content}` — the `SKILL.md`
    text directly, or just `{name}` for a name-only skill.

#### 3.1.1 Skill package upload / download

- `POST /expert_skill_uploads` — body `{file_name, file_size}` (`.zip`/`.skill`,
  ≤ 20 MiB). Returns `{upload_object_key, presigned_url, method, headers, expires_in}`.
  `PUT` the raw bytes to `presigned_url` with `headers`, then reference
  `upload_object_key` in a create/update skill (§4.1/§4.5).
- `GET /experts/{expert_id}/skill_md?i={index}` — returns `{content}`, the
  stored `SKILL.md` text for the skill at `index`. `404` when the skill has no
  stored content (`has_content=false`) or the index is out of range.
- `GET /squads/{squad_id}/skill_md?member={member_key}&i={index}` — the
  squad-member twin.
- `GET /experts/{expert_id}/skill_download?i={index}` — returns
  `{download_url}`, a short-lived presigned GET URL for the skill package at
  `index`. `404` when the skill has no stored package.
- `GET /squads/{squad_id}/skill_download?member={member_key}&i={index}` — the
  squad-member twin.

Object-key scheme (each stored skill gets a unique per-record folder, so a
PATCH never overwrites another skill's objects): the SKILL.md at
`experts/{id}/skills/{uuid}/SKILL.md` (member:
`squads/{id}/members/{mk}/skills/{uuid}/SKILL.md`) and the package at the
sibling `.../skill.zip`. Uploaded-but-not-committed packages live under
`expert-uploads/{upload_id}/…` and are deleted on commit; objects orphaned by a
PATCH are left for deferred GC (none in v1).

### 3.2 `ExpertAgentDetail`

Full record for `GET /experts/{expert_id}`, `POST /experts`,
`PATCH /experts/{expert_id}`.

```json
{
  "expert_id": "01HK7Z3B9YV0K5H0KR6QF8N4M2",
  "short_name": "架构",
  "name": "后端架构师",
  "summary": "评审服务边界、数据模型和可靠性方案。",
  "category": "研发工具",
  "tags": ["架构评审", "可靠性"],
  "publisher": "Octo Community",
  "visibility": "public",
  "creator_name": "王决",
  "created_by_type": "human",
  "instruction": "你是资深后端架构师……",
  "mcp_config": "{ \"mcpServers\": { \"git\": { … } } }",
  "skills": [{"name": "架构评审清单"}, {"name": "容量估算模板"}],
  "created_at": "2026-08-06T10:15:00.000+08:00",
  "updated_at": "2026-08-06T10:15:00.000+08:00"
}
```

Field notes:

- `expert_id`: server-generated opaque UUIDv7 (36-char) string. Opaque to
  clients; never derived from `name`.
- `short_name`: 1–4 char tile label. Server-derived from `name` (first 2
  characters) when the client omits it.
- `category`: the category **NAME** from the dedicated `expert_categories`
  table (§5) — e.g. `营销策划`. Stored as a `category_id`; the service resolves
  name → id on write and id → name on read. `""` or an unknown name is rejected
  on write with `VALIDATION_ERROR`.
- `tags`: string array of names; de-duplicated + trimmed server-side. Stored
  as tag ids against the `expert_tags` dictionary (§3.7) and resolved back to
  names on read.
- `publisher`: display org string. Defaults to the caller's workspace label.
- `visibility`: `public` / `private` / `system`. `system` never appears in a
  client write; it appears in reads for platform-provided records.
- `creator_name`: snapshot of the owner's `Identity.name` at create time.
- `created_by_type`: `human` / `bot` / `import`; always present. Semantics
  identical to `mcp-v1.md` §3.1. `created_by_bot_uid` / `created_by_bot_name`
  present only when `created_by_type == "bot"`.
- `instruction` / `mcp_config` / `skills`: the `ExpertSpec` (§3.1).
- `view_count` / `install_count`: read-only counters hydrated from
  `resource_metrics` (`resource_type = "expert"`, or `"squad"` for the §3.5/§3.6
  twins). `view_count` is bumped by `POST /metrics/track`; `install_count` is
  bumped server-side when `POST /{experts|squads}/{id}/install` succeeds. A
  squad install bumps only the squad's counter — never its member experts'.
  Counters are eventually consistent: events buffer in Redis and flush to
  `resource_metrics` on a periodic worker (default every 30 s), so a read
  immediately after a view/install can lag by up to one flush interval.
- `created_at` / `updated_at`: RFC 3339, millisecond precision, server-local
  timezone.

Server-only fields (never accepted from the client): `expert_id`, `owner_uid`
(never surfaced), `short_name` (derivable), `creator_name`, `created_by_type`,
`created_by_bot_uid`, `created_by_bot_name`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
Request bodies are strict — unknown or server-owned fields yield
`VALIDATION_ERROR`.

### 3.3 `ExpertAgentListItem`

Projection for `GET /experts` and `GET /experts/mine`. Drops the heavy
`ExpertSpec` payload (`instruction` / `mcp_config` / `skills`) — those load on
detail. `skill_count` is the length of the dropped `skills` array (the squad
twin §3.6 carries `member_count` the same way).

```json
{
  "expert_id": "01HK7Z3B9YV0K5H0KR6QF8N4M2",
  "short_name": "架构",
  "name": "后端架构师",
  "summary": "评审服务边界、数据模型和可靠性方案。",
  "category": "研发工具",
  "tags": ["架构评审", "可靠性"],
  "publisher": "Octo Community",
  "visibility": "public",
  "creator_name": "王决",
  "created_by_type": "human",
  "skill_count": 2,
  "view_count": 128,
  "install_count": 6
}
```

### 3.4 `SquadMember`

One member inside a squad. An `ExpertSpec` (§3.1) plus team-role metadata.
Members are self-contained snapshots — NOT foreign keys into `experts` (see
brief). `template_id` is a plain string used only by the client-side install
prompt.

```json
{
  "member_key": "tech_lead",
  "template_id": "expert-tech-lead",
  "name": "技术负责人",
  "role": "拆解方案并调度成员",
  "is_leader": true,
  "instruction": "你是……",
  "mcp_config": "{ \"mcpServers\": {} }",
  "skills": [{"name": "架构评审清单"}]
}
```

- `member_key`: stable key used by the client install prompt to bind
  `memberKey → agentId`. Server fills a default `member_NN` when omitted.
- `template_id`: template identifier for the install prompt; free string,
  server fills `expert-{squad_id}-NN` when omitted. Never an FK.
- `name` / `role`: required. `is_leader`: exactly one member SHOULD be leader;
  the server normalizes `is_leader` to a single member — the first one flagged,
  or the first member when none is flagged.
- `instruction` / `mcp_config` / `skills`: the member's `ExpertSpec`.

> Precedence of `leader` vs `is_leader`: the boolean `is_leader` is the
> authoritative flag (normalized to exactly one member above); the top-level
> `leader` **string** is only the display name. When a write supplies both, the
> `leader` string is stored verbatim for display and may name a member other
> than the flagged one — clients that need the leader identity should read
> `is_leader`, not match the `leader` string.

### 3.5 `ExpertSquadDetail`

Full record for `GET /squads/{squad_id}`, `POST /squads`,
`PATCH /squads/{squad_id}`. Shares the generic marketplace fields with
`ExpertAgentDetail` and swaps the `ExpertSpec` for squad payload.

```json
{
  "squad_id": "01HK7Z3B9YV0K5H0KR6QF8N4M2",
  "short_name": "研发",
  "name": "软件研发交付团",
  "summary": "从需求澄清到开发测试的一条软件研发协作链路。",
  "category": "研发工具",
  "tags": ["需求分析", "前后端开发", "自动化测试"],
  "publisher": "Mininglamp-OSS",
  "visibility": "public",
  "creator_name": "林澈",
  "created_by_type": "bot",
  "created_by_bot_uid": "bot_01HZR…",
  "created_by_bot_name": "研发交付助手",
  "leader": "技术负责人",
  "strategies": [
    "技术负责人先澄清需求、范围和验收标准，再形成技术拆分。",
    "方案确认后并行调用前端与后端；两者共享同一份接口契约。"
  ],
  "dependencies": {
    "blocking": ["codex-runtime", "git-mcp"],
    "recommended": ["GPT-5.2 或同等能力模型"]
  },
  "permission": "读取工作区文件、创建专家配置、写入专家团关系",
  "members": [ /* SquadMember[] (§3.4), order preserved */ ],
  "created_at": "2026-08-06T10:15:00.000+08:00",
  "updated_at": "2026-08-06T10:15:00.000+08:00"
}
```

Field notes:

- `leader`: display name of the leader member. Server derives it from the
  member flagged `is_leader` when omitted.
- `strategies`: ordered string array; the dispatch rules. Empty → the client
  falls back to `DEFAULT_STRATEGIES` for display; the server stores whatever
  is sent.
- `dependencies`: `{blocking: string[], recommended: string[]}`.
- `permission`: free-text permission summary.
- `members`: `SquadMember[]`, order preserved. At least 1 member required on
  create; `VALIDATION_ERROR` otherwise.

### 3.6 `ExpertSquadListItem`

Projection for `GET /squads` and `GET /squads/mine`. Drops `strategies` /
`dependencies` / `permission` / `members`; adds a `member_count`.

```json
{
  "squad_id": "01HK7Z3B9YV0K5H0KR6QF8N4M2",
  "short_name": "研发",
  "name": "软件研发交付团",
  "summary": "…",
  "category": "研发工具",
  "tags": ["需求分析", "前后端开发"],
  "publisher": "Mininglamp-OSS",
  "visibility": "public",
  "creator_name": "林澈",
  "created_by_type": "bot",
  "member_count": 5,
  "view_count": 42,
  "install_count": 3
}
```

### 3.7 Tags storage

Tags are a per-Space dictionary (`expert_tags`, shared by both entities) plus a
`tags_json` array of tag **ids** on each row — the `skill_tags` +
`skills.tags` design, NOT MCP's inline free-form strings. On the **wire**, tags
are always string **names** (matching the frontend). On write the server upserts
each name into `expert_tags` for the caller's Space and stores the resulting
ids; on read it resolves ids back to names. `space_id = ''` denotes a global
tag. Clients never see tag ids.

## 4. Endpoints

Two symmetric families. `{entity}` below is `experts` or `squads`; behavior is
identical except for the payload shape (§3) and the resource id field name
(`expert_id` / `squad_id`).

### 4.1 `POST /experts` — create expert

Publish a new standalone expert owned by the caller.

**Request body** (flat; `ExpertAgentDetail` minus server-only fields):

```json
{
  "name": "后端架构师",
  "summary": "评审服务边界、数据模型和可靠性方案。",
  "category": "研发工具",
  "tags": ["架构评审", "可靠性"],
  "instruction": "你是资深后端架构师……",
  "mcp_config": "{ \"mcpServers\": { \"git\": { … } } }",
  "skills": [{"name": "架构评审清单"}, {"name": "容量估算模板"}]
}
```

- `name` and `summary` are required; every other field has a documented
  default. `category` must be a valid category NAME (§5).
- New records are always persisted `public`. A `visibility` field may be sent
  for compatibility but is ignored; `system` is rejected with
  `err.marketplace.expert.invalid_visibility`.
- `mcp_config` is validated per §6.

**Response (201):** the full `ExpertAgentDetail`.

**Errors:** 400 `err.marketplace.expert.invalid_request` /
`invalid_visibility` / `invalid_mcp_config` · 401
`err.marketplace.auth.unauthorized` · 403
`err.marketplace.auth.forbidden_space` · 409
`err.marketplace.expert.name_taken`.

### 4.2 `GET /experts` — list (Space-scoped)

Returns every expert visible to the caller in their current Space: all `system`
records, plus all `public` records in `X-Space-Id`, plus the caller's own
`private` records.

**Query parameters** (identical set for all four list endpoints):

| Name | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `keyword` | string | — | Case-insensitive substring match against `name`, `summary`, `category`, `creator_name`. Tags excluded (owned by the `tag` filter). |
| `category` | string (repeatable) | `all` | `category_id`; `all` disables the filter. Repeat or comma-separate to OR-combine. |
| `tag` | string (repeatable) | — | Tag-name filter; repeat / comma-separate to AND-combine. |
| `visibility` | string (repeatable) | — | `system` / `public` / `private`; OR-combine. |
| `created_by_type` | string (repeatable) | — | `human` / `bot` / `import`; OR-combine. |
| `sort` | string | — | `comprehensive` → weighted blend of `install_count × 5 + view_count` plus a recency boost (mirrors the skill catalog); `installs` / `views` → the matching `resource_metrics` counter DESC; `latest` → creation-time DESC (explicit form of the default); `updated` → `updated_at DESC, id DESC`; anything else (including `relevance` without special handling) → default (creation-time DESC). |
| `page` | int | `1` | One-based page number. |
| `page_size` | int | `20` | Max `100`. |

> Note: `category` here is the category **id** (as returned by
> `GET /expert_categories` in `expert_category_id`), whereas in create/update/read
> **bodies** `category` is the category **NAME** (§5). Same field name, two
> representations — the list filter takes the id, the resource shape takes the name.
> `keyword` matching against `category` resolves the name through the taxonomy.

**Response (200):**

```json
{ "data": [ /* ExpertAgentListItem[] */ ],
  "pagination": { "total": 6, "page": 1, "page_size": 20 } }
```

`total` is the count after filters, before pagination. Default order: newest
first (`created_at DESC`, tie-broken by `id DESC`).

**Errors:** 401 / 403.

### 4.3 `GET /experts/mine`

Every expert owned by the caller in their Space, regardless of visibility
(including own `private`). Never leaks another user's rows. Same query params
and envelope as §4.2, restricted to `owner_uid == caller`.

**Errors:** 401 / 403.

### 4.4 `GET /experts/{expert_id}` — detail

Returns `ExpertAgentDetail` if visible: `visibility == system`, OR
(`space_id == X-Space-Id` AND (`public` OR `owner_uid == caller`)). Otherwise
`404 err.marketplace.expert.not_found` — never 403 — closing cross-Space
enumeration.

**Errors:** 401 / 403 (auth) / 404.

### 4.5 `PATCH /experts/{expert_id}` — update

Partial update; owner only (else `err.marketplace.expert.forbidden`).

- **Mutable:** `name`, `summary`, `category`, `tags`, `instruction`,
  `mcp_config`, `skills`. A `visibility` field is accepted but ignored,
  preserving current visibility.
- **Immutable:** `expert_id`, `owner_uid`, `space_id`, `creator_name`,
  `created_by_*`, `created_at` — rejected as unknown fields.

**Response (200):** updated `ExpertAgentDetail`.

**Errors:** 400 (`invalid_request` / `invalid_mcp_config`) · 401 · 403
(`forbidden_space` / `forbidden`) · 404 · 409 (`name_taken` on rename
collision).

### 4.6 `DELETE /experts/{expert_id}` — soft delete

Owner only. Row soft-deleted (`deleted_at = now()`); list + detail treat it as
gone; the name frees up for reuse. **Response (200):** `{"data":{}}`. **Errors:**
401 / 403 / 404.

### 4.6.1 `POST /experts/{expert_id}/install` — provision to a Loop workspace/runtime

Provision the expert as a Loop agent in the caller's chosen workspace/runtime.
The server, acting **as the calling user** (the octo `Token` is forwarded to
octo-fleet, which enforces workspace membership, runtime access, and space
scoping — this service does not re-check them):

1. resolves the **visible** expert (§4.4 visibility rule),
2. creates a Loop agent seeded with the expert's `instruction` + `mcp_config`,
3. creates one workspace skill per packaged skill and attaches its supporting
   files, then binds the skills to the agent.

On any partial failure it **rolls back** the agent and every skill it created
(best-effort, on a context detached from the request so cancellation still
cleans up). The whole install is bounded by an aggregate timeout, and the total
supporting-file fan-out is capped across all skills (a package exceeding it →
`400`).

**Request:**

```json
{ "workspace_id": "ws-123", "runtime_id": "rt-456" }
```

**Response (200):**

```json
{ "data": { "agent_id": "agent-789" } }
```

**Errors:** 400 (`invalid_request` — missing workspace/runtime, or an install
that exceeds the resource caps) · 401 · 403 · 404 (expert not visible) · 409
(fleet rejects a duplicate agent name in the workspace) · 500 · 503
(`UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE` when octo-fleet is unconfigured or unavailable).

### 4.7–4.12 `/squads` family

Identical verbs and semantics to §4.1–4.6, with the squad payload (§3.5/§3.6)
and `squad_id`:

- `POST /squads` — create. Body is the flat squad shape: generic fields +
  `leader` / `strategies` / `dependencies` / `permission` / `members`.
  `members` requires ≥ 1 entry; each member is validated as an `ExpertSpec` +
  role metadata (§3.4), including per-member `mcp_config` validation (§6).
  Malformed members → `err.marketplace.expert.invalid_members`.
  **Response (201):** `ExpertSquadDetail`.
- `GET /squads` / `GET /squads/mine` — same query params + envelope as §4.2/§4.3,
  returning `ExpertSquadListItem[]` (with `member_count`).
- `GET /squads/{squad_id}` — `ExpertSquadDetail`; same visibility rule as §4.4.
- `PATCH /squads/{squad_id}` — owner-only partial update. Mutable: generic
  fields + `leader` / `strategies` / `dependencies` / `permission` /
  `members`. Sending `members` **replaces** the whole array (full-replace, not
  merge) — the client always submits the complete member list, mirroring the
  octo-web squad editor. Immutable fields as §4.5.
- `DELETE /squads/{squad_id}` — soft delete; 200 `{"data":{}}`.
- `POST /squads/{squad_id}/install` — provision the squad into a Loop
  workspace/runtime. Body `{ "workspace_id", "runtime_id" }`. The server first
  installs **each member** as a Loop agent (create agent seeded with the
  member's instruction + `mcp_config`, create + bind its packaged skills; exact
  duplicate Skill names are first-wins across members, while case/whitespace
  variants remain distinct), then
  **forms the squad** via octo-fleet: create it led by the leader member (first
  member flagged `is_leader`, else the one whose name matches the squad `leader`
  label, else the first member — fleet auto-adds the leader as a member), write
  the squad's `strategies` as its Loop instructions (one numbered line per
  rule, via a bounded-retry follow-up squad update; skipped when the squad has no
  strategies), and attach the remaining members with their roles. Aggregates the fleet calls on
  behalf of the caller (forwarded token, so fleet enforces workspace membership
  — squad create requires owner/admin — runtime access, and space scoping) and
  **rolls back** the squad plus every provisioned member agent on any partial
  failure. **Response (200):** `{ "squad_id", "leader_agent_id" }`. Mirrors the
  single-agent expert flow `POST /experts/{expert_id}/install`. **Errors:** 400
  (`invalid_request`, incl. a squad with no members, or an install that exceeds
  the aggregate resource caps) · 401 · 403 · 404 · 409 (fleet rejects a duplicate
  agent/squad name in the workspace) · 500 · 503 (`UPSTREAM_UNAVAILABLE` when
  octo-fleet is unconfigured or unavailable).

  **Request:** `{ "workspace_id": "ws-123", "runtime_id": "rt-456" }` —
  **Response (200):** `{ "data": { "squad_id": "sq-1", "leader_agent_id": "agent-1" } }`.

**Errors:** same catalog as the experts family, with
`err.marketplace.expert.invalid_members` added on create/update.

### 4.13 `GET /expert_tags` — tag suggestions

Tags aggregated from records visible to the caller in the current Space, sorted
by descending row count (alphabetical tie-break). Mirrors `GET /mcp_tags`.

**Query parameters:**

| Name | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `kind` | string | `agent` | `agent` aggregates over `experts`; `squad` over `expert_squads`. The octo-web tag popover is per-tab, so it requests the current tab's kind. |
| `q` | string | — | Case-insensitive substring match on tag name; empty → all visible tags. |
| `limit` | int | `50` | Clamped to `[1, 100]`. |
| `mode` | string | — | `mine` restricts to caller-owned rows; absent → full visible set. |

**Response:**

```json
{ "data": [ { "name": "架构评审", "count": 3 }, { "name": "可靠性", "count": 2 } ] }
```

Visibility scope matches §4.2. Empty tags and soft-deleted rows excluded. No
pagination.

**Errors:** 401 / 403.

## 5. Categories

Experts and squads use a **dedicated `expert_categories` table** (migration
`20260806-01`) — separate from the shared skill `categories` table. On the wire,
`category` on every expert/squad shape is the category **NAME** (e.g. `营销策划`)
in BOTH directions; storage is a `category_id` (VARCHAR(36)) on
`experts` / `expert_squads`. The service resolves name → id on write (unknown or
empty name → `VALIDATION_ERROR`) and id → name on read.

The 6 seeded categories (id / name / lucide icon_key / sort_order):

| id | name | icon_key | sort_order |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `marketing-planning` | 营销策划 | `Megaphone` | 1 |
| `content-creation` | 内容创作 | `PenLine` | 2 |
| `ad-delivery` | 广告投放 | `Target` | 3 |
| `data-insight` | 数据洞察 | `ChartColumn` | 4 |
| `office-efficiency` | 办公提效 | `BriefcaseBusiness` | 5 |
| `dev-tools` | 研发工具 | `Code2` | 6 |

### 5.1 `GET /expert_categories` — category chips

Returns every live category with the number of records **visible to the caller**
of the requested kind in the caller's Space, so the octo-web 专家市场 tab can
render category chips with live counts.

**Query parameters:**

| Name | Type | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `kind` | string | `agent` | `agent` counts `experts`; `squad` counts `expert_squads`. |

**Response (200):**

```json
{ "data": [ { "expert_category_id": "marketing-planning", "name": "营销策划", "count": 3 } ] }
```

- `count` is the number of records of the kind visible to the caller — the same
  visible-set rule as the list endpoints (§4.2): `system OR (space + (public OR
  owner))`, soft-deleted excluded.
- ALL categories are returned (a category with no visible records reports
  `count: 0`), ordered by `sort_order`.

**Errors:** 401 / 403.


## 6. `mcp_config` handling

Applied on every write (`POST`, `PATCH`) for the expert top-level `mcp_config`
and for each squad member's `mcp_config`:

- **Validated as well-formed JSON.** A non-empty value that does not parse is
  rejected with `err.marketplace.expert.invalid_mcp_config`
  (`VALIDATION_ERROR`). Empty string / omitted is allowed (no MCP).
- **Size-capped** (v1: 64 KiB per config). Oversized → `VALIDATION_ERROR`.
- **Stored verbatim** as text (MEDIUMTEXT), preserving the author's exact
  formatting; returned byte-for-byte on read. The server does NOT reformat,
  reorder keys, parse into server descriptors, spawn any process, or fetch any
  URL. Treated purely as an opaque, untrusted config document.
- **No secret redaction in v1** (brief Out-of-scope). Authors are guided by the
  frontend to use `SECRET_PLACEHOLDER_SENTINEL` (§0) instead of real tokens. A
  later slice may add env-value blanking mirroring `mcp-v1.md` §5 once a real
  install flow exists.

## 7. Performance & limits (v1 posture)

Sized for prototype scale; revisit on scale metrics. Mirrors `mcp-v1.md` §7.

- **`GET` keyword search is a full scan** over the caller's visible set
  (`name`/`summary` `LIKE %kw%`, non-sargable). Fine while a Space has
  < ~10 k records per entity; beyond that add FULLTEXT or a sidecar index.
- **Uniqueness** on `(owner_uid, space_id, name)` for live rows in each entity
  table is enforced by a DB-level UNIQUE index over a STORED generated column
  `name_live = IF(deleted_at IS NULL, name, NULL)`. A duplicate live tuple
  fails with MySQL duplicate-key (1062), mapped to `DUPLICATE`; soft-deleted
  rows carry `name_live = NULL` so the name frees up after delete. The
  `SELECT … FOR UPDATE` pre-check recipe is FORBIDDEN (proven to deadlock under
  concurrency — see `mcp-v1.md` §7); the repository does a plain insert/update
  and maps the duplicate-key error.
- **System name uniqueness** is platform-wide: `system` rows store
  `space_id = NULL`, and NULL tuples never collide in a MySQL unique index, so
  the owner/space index above cannot cover them. A second generated column
  `system_name_live = IF(visibility = 'system' AND deleted_at IS NULL, name,
  NULL)` with its own UNIQUE index (`uq_expert_system_name_live` /
  `uq_squad_system_name_live`, migration `20260813-00`) makes admin
  create/rename atomic under concurrency; the admin service keeps a SELECT
  pre-check only as a friendly fast path. Duplicates map to `DUPLICATE`.
- **"我的" spans two entity tables** → two queries; the frontend renders them
  in separate sections so no merge/interleave is needed.
- **Timestamps** are RFC 3339 ms in server-local timezone.

## 8. Change management

- New fields land in this doc first, then implementation.
- Renaming / removing a field is breaking: publish a `v2` doc and keep `v1`
  handlers alive until clients migrate.
- Adding an optional field with a safe default is backward-compatible.
- `ExpertSpec` (§3.1) is a shared shape; a change to it affects both the expert
  top level and squad members — version both together.

## 9. Admin surface

A separate admin surface manages platform-provided (`visibility = system`)
records — mirroring `mcp-v1.md` §9, and gated the same way: the resolved
identity must carry `role == "superAdmin"` or `role == "marketAdmin"`. The
public surface still REJECTS `visibility = system` on write.

Implemented endpoints (all under `/api/v1/admin`, gated by
`AdminAuthenticator`; wire shapes reuse §3, and generated OpenAPI under
`docs/openapi/` is the field-level reference — tag `admin_expert`):

- `POST/GET /admin/experts`, `GET/PATCH/DELETE /admin/experts/{expert_id}` —
  create stamps `visibility = system`; a client-sent `visibility` is rejected
  with `400 VALIDATION_ERROR` (the field is declared on the shared create
  shape, so the strict decoder accepts it — the admin service refuses it
  explicitly). List bypasses Space scoping and pages by `page`/`page_size`;
  create/patch bodies are §4.1/§4.5 shapes. System names are unique
  platform-wide (§7); a collision is `409 DUPLICATE`.
- `GET /admin/experts/{expert_id}/skill_md?i=N` — stored SKILL.md text of the
  skill at index `i` (§3.1 `SkillContentResp`).
- The same six verbs for squads under `/admin/squads`, plus
  `GET /admin/squads/{squad_id}/skill_md?member=<member_key>&i=N`.
- `GET/POST /admin/expert_categories`,
  `PATCH/DELETE /admin/expert_categories/{category_id}` — taxonomy management;
  delete is rejected 409 with the reference count while records still use the
  category. NOTE: update writes all three columns (`name`, `icon_key`,
  `sort_order`) — clients must echo the current `icon_key` back or it is
  cleared.
- `GET /admin/expert_tags?kind=agent|squad` — tag aggregation over system rows.
- `POST /admin/expert_skill_uploads` — the §5 presigned-upload handshake,
  reused verbatim.
