// TestDeletingAPluginCollectsNoObjects pins the storage policy the delete cascade
// deliberately does NOT adopt.
//
// Deleting a plugin cancels its pending review request (see the cascade in
// Repo.Delete / Repo.DeleteGraph), and on who-is-acting alone that looks like the
// reject/cancel case: the author is abandoning their own submission, and cancel
// garbage-collects the objects that submission spilled. It stops short because
// delete is a SOFT delete — the row, its plugin_versions history and its live
// attachment sidecar are all kept — and nothing in this service ever deletes a
// plugin's own objects. Collecting only the submission's spill would make delete
// the single place a soft delete performs an irreversible external side effect, on
// the smallest slice of what it is knowingly leaving behind.
//
// The choice is asymmetric on purpose: every row a later sweeper would need
// survives the soft delete, so the same difference can still be computed with more
// context, whereas an object-storage delete does not come back.
//
// This test cannot be made red by reverting the cascade — it guards the opposite
// mistake. Wiring any object GC into the delete path turns it red, which is the
// signal to come back and re-argue the comment rather than quietly change it.
