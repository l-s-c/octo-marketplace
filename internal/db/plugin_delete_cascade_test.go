// request from outliving its plugin in a state nobody can leave.
//
// Deleting the plugin used to leave the request `pending` forever. It is not just
// untidy — it is unreachable in BOTH directions. Every read (ListReviewRequests,
// GetReviewRequest, LoadReviewSnapshot) carries `p.deleted_at IS NULL`, so neither
// the applicant nor a reviewer can see the row at all; and every decision path
// loads the plugin through getReviewedPluginForUpdate, which refuses a deleted
// one, so the applicant's own CancelReview answers `plugin not found`. Relaxing
// any single one of those would be dead code, because the request is
// undiscoverable before it is unsettleable. Only the deleting transaction can
// reach it.
//
// The frozen sidecar is asserted intact on purpose: delete deliberately does NOT
// garbage-collect the submission's storage objects, because a soft delete keeps
// the plugin's own row, versions and live sidecar and nothing in this service ever
// deletes a plugin's objects. Collecting only the submission's spill would be the
