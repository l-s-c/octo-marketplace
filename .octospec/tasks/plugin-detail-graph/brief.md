# Plugin: detail_graph aggregated endpoint

## Goal

Rendering an Expert Team detail page on octo-web today costs `1 + N + N×M` calls
to `GET /plugins/detail` (root → N members → M skills/connectors per member).
Each response carries the heavy `plugin_json` blob and full-normalizes every
JSON field, forcing the frontend to stitch the tree client-side. This task
adds a new endpoint `GET /plugins/detail_graph?plugin_id=…` that returns the
root (full projection, byte-identical to today's `/plugins/detail`) plus every
edge in the transitive closure and a deduplicated list of related plugins in
light projection (manifest only, no `plugin_json`). The existing
`/plugins/detail` endpoint is preserved byte-for-byte; no migration, no model
change, no admin surface change in this task.

## Load-bearing behavior

- New endpoint is **additive**: `GET /plugins/detail_graph`,
  `@ID plugin.graph.get`, mounted on the public plugin router (tenant-scoped,
  Bearer auth). Route naming follows the existing verb-suffix, query-param-id
  convention on the public surface.
- Response is a **flat** (not nested) envelope:
  ```
  { data: {
      plugin:         pluginResponse,         // full, same as /plugins/detail
      relations:      relationResponse[],     // closure of all edges, data intact
      related_plugins: listItemResponse[]     // light, deduped, no plugin_json
  } }
  ```
  No `graph`/`node_count`/`is_partial`/`truncated` meta object is emitted.
- Traversal depth is fixed by the relation matrix and derived from the root
  plugin's type — no `depth` query param:
  - `skill` / `connector` (leaves): zero edge queries beyond the root fetch.
  - `expert` (container of skills/connectors): one level of edges.
  - `expert_team` (container of experts): up to two levels (members + their
    skills/connectors).
- The endpoint performs **at most 4 SQL round-trips** regardless of fan-out
  (1 for a leaf root, 2 when no child is visible): root fetch → level-1 edges →
  (optional) level-2 edges → one batch payload fetch for all related nodes using
  `pluginSummaryColumns` (which deliberately omits `plugin_json`, reusing an
  existing column list).
- **Two caps, both enforced mid-scan**: node cap 630 and edge cap 2000. Both are
  anchored to the writer that actually mints squad graphs — container import,
  which admits `containerMaxMembers` (30) members each declaring up to
  `containerMaxSkills` (20) skills, and dedupes embedded skills only by
  `(file, name)`. A maximum-size legal import is therefore 30 + 30×20 = 630
  child nodes and one edge per child, and that squad's detail page must render
  rather than 413 forever; the install budget (`maxInstallRelationTargets` = 500)
  is the wrong anchor and sits below what import accepts. The edge cap is
  separate because the node cap alone does not bound cost — a graph whose members
  share targets keeps the unique-node count low while edges grow as
  members × targets-per-member, and `maxRelations` permits 200 edges per plugin
  (≈40k in a two-hop closure); 2000 allows ~3× the container ceiling for
  shared-target squads and fails closed above it. Both caps are checked while
  draining each result set, and each edge query carries
  `LIMIT maxGraphEdges + 1`, so an over-cap graph is neither fully materialized
  in the process nor fully sorted and shipped by MySQL. Exceeding either returns
  HTTP 413 `PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE` with `details.max_nodes` and `details.max_edges`;
  the endpoint fails closed rather than silently truncating, so the UI never
  renders a partial squad. The repository mirrors the two container constants
  locally; `TestGraphCapsClearContainerImportCeiling` fails if they drift.
- **Hidden related plugins are silently omitted** — edge and node both —
  matching the existing `/plugins/detail` behavior. No truncation flag, no
  error. This is deliberately different from the install path's fail-closed
  `ErrDependencyHidden`; install needs to refuse a partial provision, but a
  read-only detail page should degrade gracefully when cross-space targets
  exist.
- **Every descendant is filtered by the same `visibilitySQL` that
  `/plugins/detail` applies**, on both edge queries and the node payload query —
  embedded (`is_embedded=1`) children included. Embedded children get no
  relaxation: every writer that mints them (container import, container
  reupload, `RebuildGraph`, backfill) stamps each child with its container top's
  `(visibility, space_id, owner_uid)`, so `visibilitySQL` on a child is already
  equivalent to `visibilitySQL` on the container authorized as the root. A
  relaxation would return no additional rows while permanently dropping the
  per-row guard, leaving any future divergence between container and children to
  disclose them cross-Space with no code change here.
- Icons are resolved per-request with memoization by raw icon key (no extra
  allocations for shared icons). No `member_count` is derived onto any node: the
  relation matrix never admits an `expert_team` as a relation target, so a
  related node is never a team, and the root's response projection carries no
  `member_count` field. A client counts `expert_team_expert` edges in the
  returned relation slice, which is also the only count consistent with the
  caller's visibility.
- View/install/download counters are read-only projections on the existing
  read path; detail reads never write metrics, so fanning out to related
  plugins cannot bump their view counts.
- An extra `space_id` predicate on children is deliberately NOT imposed:
  `visibilitySQL` is not a pure space predicate — its
  `visibility IN ('public','system')` branch admits system-visibility children
  regardless of `space_id` — so a `space_id` match would incorrectly hide the
  NULL-space embedded members of a system-visible container from a caller who
  can legitimately see that container.
- The new repo primitive is not generalized to an arbitrary-ID batch read;
  `GetGraphClosure(ctx, scope, rootID string)` takes a single root ID, so the
  traversal is always anchored on one authorized root. The admin route for the same shape is intentionally deferred (repo
  works under `scope.Admin = true` as-is; handler veneer can be added when the
  admin console needs it). The install path is deliberately not refactored in
  this task — it is fail-closed and needs full `plugin_json` per node; sharing
  the primitive would require a visibility-mode and package-blob toggle that
  are separate concerns.
- API envelope and error codes use the fixed OCTO enum; swaggo annotations
  follow the project house style; `make openapi-check` must pass.

## Out of scope

- Admin surface (`/admin/plugins/:id/detail_graph`) — left for follow-up.
- Install-path refactor.
- Any new migration, model field, plugin type, or relation type.
- Changing `/plugins/detail` shape or behavior.
- Re-adding any backend-side secret value scanning.

## Acceptance

- New endpoint `GET /api/v1/plugins/detail_graph?plugin_id=…` returns 200 with
  the flat graph envelope.
- Root plugin byte-matches `/plugins/detail`'s plugin projection (including
  `plugin_json`). Related plugins do not carry `plugin_json` (verified by
  wire-JSON assertion in handler tests).
- For a system team in the local dev DB, the endpoint returns its 4 embedded
  members plus reachable embedded skills with a single HTTP call; children do
  not carry `plugin_json`.
- Leaf (skill/connector) roots return empty edges/related with no edge query
  issued; expert roots issue one edge query; expert_team roots issue two.
- Children the caller cannot see are silently omitted (edge + node both),
  embedded and standalone alike; a node that vanishes between the edge scan and
  the payload query drops both itself and every edge touching it.
- Node cap (630) and edge cap (2000) both fire mid-scan, before the payload
  query issues; over-cap returns 413 with `details.max_nodes` /
  `details.max_edges`. A wide-but-shallow graph that stays under the node cap
  while exceeding the edge cap is pinned by test, and a maximum-size legal
  container import (30 members × 20 embedded skills = 630 nodes, 630 edges) is
  pinned as renderable.
- Missing `plugin_id` → 400; unknown id → 404. 401 is enforced by the router's
  authenticator middleware and is not exercised by the handler tests, whose
  shared `testEngine` always stamps a fixed dev identity.
- `go vet ./...`, `gofmt`, `make build`, `go test ./internal/...`,
  `make openapi-check` (with regenerated `docs/openapi/swagger.yaml`
  committed) all pass.
- No regression: existing `/plugins/detail` returns unchanged shape and
  relation counts; full `go test ./...` green.
